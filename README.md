Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict diseases based on input symptoms using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). It provides detailed predictions about potential diseases and offers additional outputs such as:

Recommended Medications: Suggestions for medications based on the predicted disease.
Dietary Recommendations: Diet plans tailored to the disease prediction.
Disease Descriptions: Information about the predicted diseases for better understanding.
The model is trained on historical health data and integrates multiple datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The goal of this project is to provide a useful tool for quick and effective disease diagnosis based on symptoms.
